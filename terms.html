      <h2>1. Overview</h2>
      <p>
        CrewTech (“we”, “us”, “our”) is a tool that helps convention and event
        leads manage jobs, shifts, and workers, including sending job details
        and schedule reminders by SMS and web links.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using CrewTech (including the admin dashboard or worker portal),
        you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, you should
        not use the service.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>2. Who can use CrewTech</h2>
      <p>You may use CrewTech only if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are at least 18 years old, and</li>
        <li>
          You have authority to receive and respond to work-related messages
          from the person or company managing your shifts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a crew lead / admin, you confirm that any workers you add have
        consented to be contacted about jobs and schedules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>3. Your responsibilities</h2>
      <p>As an admin / crew lead, you agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use CrewTech only for legitimate work scheduling purposes.</li>
        <li>
          Enter accurate job details, dates, times, and worker contact
          information to the best of your knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          Respect worker time and privacy, and avoid sending abusive,
          harassing, or misleading messages.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a worker, you agree to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review job details carefully before confirming shifts.</li>
        <li>
          Use your personal worker link only for yourself and not share it
          publicly.
        </li>
        <li>
          Notify your lead if you believe any job details or your contact
          information are incorrect.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="legal-section">
      <h2>4. SMS messages and worker links</h2>
      <p>
        CrewTech uses SMS (text messages) to send workers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Job invitations and shift details</li>
        <li>Confirmations when a worker accepts or declines a shift</li>
        <li>
          Personal dashboard links so workers can view their own upcoming jobs
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Message frequency depends on how often your lead schedules you. Message
        and data rates may apply, according to your mobile carrier plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Workers can usually stop receiving job-related SMS from a specific
        sender by replying “STOP” to a message from that sender. Workers may
        also contact the crew lead directly and/or email us at
        <a href="mailto:crewtechteam@gmail.com">crewtechteam@gmail.com</a>
        to raise any concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        For more detail on how we handle SMS and data, please review our
        <a href="legal.html">Privacy &amp; SMS Policy</a>.
